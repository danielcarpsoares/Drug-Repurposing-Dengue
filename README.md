# Drug Repurposing Dengue

Repository with code for the analysis of Microarray and RNA-Seq data from Dengue cohorts

**I - Introduction**

The workflow here described for the analysis of Microarray and RNA-Seq was performed in R. Many packages specific for Bioinformatic 
analysis were used such as "limma" or "DESeq2". Below are briefly summarized the workflows for the differential expression of Microarray
and RNA-Seq data as well as the data preparation to be used in CMap and all the plots created. 

Scripts with the code for each step here referred are in the correspondent folders.
